            <h1>About</h1>
            <p><strong>Rickie Lee Reeves</strong>, age 76, also known as <strong>Rickster</strong>, <strong>Harpdog</strong>, <strong>HarpdogRickstar</strong>, and <strong>Dad</strong>, is a lyricist, singer, harmonica player, and songwriter.</p>
            <p>He raised 10 kids and has 19 grandkids, and he loves them all.</p>
            <p>He wrote all the lyrics for his songs and played harmonica and sang on most of them. He can no longer play guitar or bass due to severe arthritis. He cannot perform live anymore because dementia and memory loss prevent him from remembering the lyrics and song details.</p>
            <p>He is a cancer survivor and a recovering drug addict who has been clean for over 50 years.</p>
            <p>He made a big mistake in 1972 and was arrested for marijuana, resulting in a felony conviction. This led to his deportation from Canada, where all of his kids and grandkids live. He wants to return to Canada but is currently prevented from doing so. He needs a Canadian immigration lawyer, but the cost is beyond his financial reach.</p>
            <p>His music is based on the truth, and he is trying to help people avoid making the same mistakes he has. Please listen to his music to help him reach this honorable goal.</p>
